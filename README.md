Manual Installer for Yubico Authenticator on Linux Desktop

### Context
I wrote about what these scripts are for and the context on my blog post:

https://debug.openaiken.net/2023/yubico-authenticator-linux-without-package-manager/

Basically, the most updated version of this app isn't in the Arch-based package repos, so this was my workaround.

**Make sure you install required dependencies.**

### Notes
These scripts are barebones and devoid of fancy bash tricks and "best practices". It's idempotent... but I could have made the code more dynamic, better at handling errors, have a config file, etc. Works though. :)
